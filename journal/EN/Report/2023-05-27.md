### Rules for Naming Test Files

When naming test files, it's crucial to clearly indicate which module is being tested. This ensures that the purpose is evident. As a result, it's common to name the test file to include the name of the module under test. For instance, if the goal is to test a file named "m_add.js," it's typical to name the corresponding test file as "m_add.test.js."

This practice will become a rule in my naming convention, and all test file names will be modified accordingly.
