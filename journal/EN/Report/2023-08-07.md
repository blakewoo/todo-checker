### Starting Refactoring

The writing of test code is complete. Although I'm a bit unsure about how to determine what went wrong if I simply mock the functions that make requests to the database and there's an issue with the DB query, I'm thinking of writing code to check by connecting to a testing DB if necessary.

For now, since the test code is mostly finished, I'm planning to move on to refactoring. The direction of refactoring is as follows:

- Removal of unnecessary features: There are unused functions in the code. I will eliminate such functions.
- Establishing a structure according to design patterns: There are portions of the code that have been put together hastily, particularly on the frontend compared to the backend. I intend to modify those parts to align with the appropriate design patterns.
