### Guidelines for Writing Test Code

I am currently in the process of writing tests for various functionalities using the Supertest tool. I am dividing the tests into scenarios with sessions and without sessions, and I am adding tests for scenarios where permissions are lacking. Additionally, I aim to conduct tests encompassing all corner cases. Once all these test cases are written, I plan to perform refactoring based on the test cases to improve the codebase.
