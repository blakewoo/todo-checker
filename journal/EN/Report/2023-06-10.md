### Dependency Injection

For dependency injection, it's necessary to separate the network-related code. Currently, there are direct query execution codes within the module. To separate the querying part into modules and proceed with the work to mock it, I am in progress.

Firstly, I am creating code that can pull CRUD operations for each collection, and by allowing each module to create new objects and pull them, it becomes easier to mock.

While designing this structure for mocking, I'm planning to study the concepts of "Classicist" and "Mockist." These are the two predominant philosophies in unit testing. Speaking precisely, it refers to "Classicist" and "Mockist" schools of thought. I'll need to check exactly what they entail.
