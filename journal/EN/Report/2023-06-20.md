### Babel and Webpack

While working on mocking mongoose, thoughts of Babel and Webpack crossed my mind. Although I'm familiar with what Babel and Webpack are, I haven't had the chance to use them firsthand. However, I have a feeling that they might be necessary for an upcoming project. So, before diving into DB mocking, I thought it would be a good idea to introduce them and organize their details.

For starters, I plan to set up Babel and Webpack together. This involves converting all post-ES6 syntax to pre-ES6 syntax and then bundling through Webpack for deployment. After completing this step, my intention is to establish the testing process by incorporating mongoose and mariadb mocking.

This strategic sequence aims to ensure smooth project development, efficient testing, and streamlined deployment.
