### Contemplation about Testing Tools

Upon investigating various testing tools, I've come to think that jest might be a better choice than Mocha. To execute tests, you need both a test runner that launches the tests and an assertion mechanism to verify test conditions. With Mocha, it serves as a test runner, requiring the use of assertion libraries like chai.js, expect.js, better-assertion, or even the built-in assert provided by Node.js.

However, jest serves as both a test runner and includes its own assertion capabilities, making it appear more user-friendly to operate. If I were to transition from Mocha to jest as the testing tool, I would also relocate the test code within the "test" folder.
