### Writing Test Code
I was mistaken in my thinking. Code should work, no matter how messy or complex it is. If the functionality doesn't work as intended, no matter how elegantly written the code is, it's essentially useless. This is something I've come to realize through my work experience.

Despite understanding this well, I didn't take the initiative to write test code before refactoring. Ideally, some level of test code should be written while developing, but I went about it without much consideration. Therefore, I intend to start by writing test code before making any structural or functional changes. I'll be using the Mocha testing tool, and if possible, I'd like to extend testing to the frontend as well, although that might require a separate approach.

My plan is to begin by writing test code for the backend modules before moving on to the frontend.
