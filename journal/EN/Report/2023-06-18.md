### Mocking DB connection 

When conducting unit tests, it's recommended to exclude network, database, and file read & write operations. This approach helps achieve better test performance and ensures proper testing. Therefore, most often, these components are mock-treated to prevent them from affecting the tests.

However, this might raise concerns about what happens if the actual DB or file read/write operations don't function correctly. It's important to note that such issues should ideally be addressed during development, which doesn't seem unreasonable.

Now that the process of dependency separation is complete, it's time to proceed with the DB mocking tasks.
