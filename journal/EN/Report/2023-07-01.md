### Webpack Bundling
Setting up Webpack and Babel to bundle necessary files on the frontend can initially feel cumbersome. However, from a management perspective, it appears to be quite beneficial. Of course, compared to directly embedding JavaScript in HTML, going through the build process for bundling does add a level of inconvenience. But, if you're using TypeScript or building through React, a separate build process is necessary, and considering that nowadays development is rarely done using vanilla JavaScript, and JavaScript is considerably more loosely structured compared to TypeScript, which is indeed superior in terms of maintainability, I believe this approach is appropriate.

Now that bundling and packaging on the frontend have been initially completed, the next step will be to proceed with writing test code. The plan is as follows:

- Mocking mongoose to eliminate elements like network or file IO during testing.
- Similarly, mocking Maria DB queries to remove elements like network or file IO during testing.
- Writing TEST CODE for the entire project.
- Based on this TEST CODE, initiate the refactoring process.
