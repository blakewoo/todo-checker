I completed the project and released version 1.0. Since it was a project I started almost as a hobby after work hours, there was no urgency, and I believed I could write good code since I took my time. However, it turned out that my coding habits were the real issue.

After reading Martin Fowler's "Refactoring," I plan to address the shortcomings in my code. Before delving into refactoring, I've identified the following issues with my current code from my own perspective:

- Inconsistent Naming Conventions: The inconsistent naming conventions make it unclear whether an identifier is a class, an ID, or something else. This lack of clarity is detrimental to reusability.

- Unnecessary Functionality: Originally, I intended to fetch the entire data and update variables on the frontend based on changes. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, I ended up fetching data from the database for each request. I need to either remove this variable altogether or modify it according to my initial plan.

- Limited to Single Process: Since sessions are maintained in memory, I cannot scale by using the pm2 package to launch processes equal to the number of cores (as session sharing isn't possible). Using only one process is inefficient unless I'm running on a 2-core server. Therefore, I should make the system capable of supporting multiple processes.

- Prototype-like Implementation: The lack of clear definitions for each object's functionality has led to a disorganized structure. I need to establish a proper structure, define the functionality for each object, and modify the code accordingly.

- Absence of Test Code: Despite having mocha in the package.json, there are no test codes. Tests are not conducted before releasing. I need to establish a process for testing before release and actually conduct testing.

For now, these are the immediate issues I've identified. I'll focus on addressing these problems and incorporate any additional issues I discover while reading the "Refactoring" book into my plan for improvement.
