### Changing Test Tools
In the end, I decided to switch my testing tool from Mocha to Jest. It seems that there are differences in the supported functions and conveniences, so I believe it's the right choice to make this switch. The test code that was previously used in Mocha will be moved to the 'ex-test' folder, and after converting it to fit Jest, it will be relocated to the 'test' folder.
