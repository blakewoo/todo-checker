### Points to consider when using Mocha  
It does not support testing through "for." If necessary, you should implement test code using "foreach."
```javascript
// Bad
let arr = [1,2,3,4]

for(let count=0;count<arr.length;count++){
    it(count+'번째 test',function () { 
        //something test code
    })
}

// Good
arr.forEach(function (value,count) {
    it(count+'번째 test',function () {
        //something test code
    })
})
```

I struggled with writing test code because of this. I think it's probably due to differences in the internally implemented approach, which might be why I can't use "for." However, I'm not quite sure about that part.
