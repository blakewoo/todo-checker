### Removing Unnecessary Features

This is the second of the several essential points mentioned on the 9th. There are a few places with unnecessary code performing irrelevant functions. Here are some examples:

- Unused update and delete functions defined within the Todo object (requires consolidation)
- TODO_Map within the Todo object not being used (renaming not done as it's slated for deletion)
- Remove and then Add eventListeners (to be replaced with a single Add)   

Addressing these examples is just the starting point. Not only will these be handled, but the original structure needs to be defined as well. However, the initial plan is to remove redundant functionalities, refine the structure, and then proceed with comprehensive changes based on the established structure.
