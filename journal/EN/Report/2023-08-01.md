### What Will Be Tested?
While I was in the process of writing test cases, a sudden thought occurred to me. I wondered whether I am currently writing test cases with clear criteria. I have been following the guidelines of FIRST, BICEP, and CORRECT, but they haven't been explicitly defined. Therefore, I plan to define them clearly here and then proceed to write test cases according to these standards.

####1. Session Verification
In the process of development, there are times when, unbelievably, authorization validation logic gets overlooked. Of course, most of the time, such code issues are discovered quickly. However, in cases where discovery is delayed or if it goes unnoticed until a security incident occurs, it's already too late. This is why one of the most essential authorization validation logics, session verification, must be checked first.

####2. Verify Intended Functionality
It goes without saying that the functionality should work as intended. If it doesn't, then the test code and efforts become meaningless.

####3. Edge Case Verification
Certain conditions are indispensable when performing CRUD operations on specific data. Failing to meet these conditions can lead to scenarios where users might not receive desired values or, in the worst cases, the server might fail to respond, causing the entire service to crash (though this typically occurs due to poor exception handling). Hence, it's crucial to check whether these conditions are properly handled.

####4. Additional Security Validation
Technically, this falls within the realm of edge case verification. This is because most security vulnerabilities arise from inadequate exception handling in such edge cases. Problems like XSS, SQL injection, and others stem from poor handling of these edge cases. However, since security-related issues within these scenarios are vast, I've explicitly mentioned this point once again.
