### Identifying Code Issues

I've come to realize once again that there are many fundamentally incorrect parts in the code. Today, I've identified two things:

- The separation through dependency injection is not properly implemented.
- In the case of unit tests, interactions between modules shouldn't be included, but they are present.
For example, network communication through both MongoDB and MariaDB.
  
As these are prime examples of bad code, I plan to address the code while keeping these two points in mind.
