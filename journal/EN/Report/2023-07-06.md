### Dependency Injection Struggle

I was going through a massive struggle. Initially, the express app needed to receive a database object when it was launched, and the service had to run based on this database. However, I found myself pondering how to perform dependency injection when I had already connected it globally. I needed to ensure that the database received during app initialization was used all the way from app startup to each module in the router.

The task turned out to be more extensive than I thought, as both the MongoDB and MariaDB aspects had to be addressed. I even went so far as to install packages for mongoose mocking, which, in retrospect, feels a bit regrettable.
