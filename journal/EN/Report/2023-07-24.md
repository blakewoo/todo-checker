### DB mocking has been successfully implemented, but there is a need for revising the test code.

By implementing dependency injection, the mocking process has been successfully completed. Enhancing code flexibility, I've introduced a practice where the necessary components are imported and utilized from modules responsible for queries rather than general modules. Although this should have been incorporated right from the start of development, I lacked the experience, so it was added later. Now, as I work on completing the test code, I've come to realize that I've been approaching the testing of a single function incorrectly. As a result, I've decided to conduct tests based on individual feature units using the URLs of routes rather than focusing on functions attached to the module.
