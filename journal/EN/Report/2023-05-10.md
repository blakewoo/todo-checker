### Consistency in Variable, Class, and ID Naming

In simple terms, it's actually about establishing naming conventions, which are a part of coding conventions. Originally, this is something that each company or development group defines and follows as their own set of rules.
I initially named things without any reason, without even considering coding conventions.

That's why on the 9th, I mentioned the goal of standardizing variables, classes, and IDs.
The reason for this standardization is that inconsistent names are not intuitive, and lack of intuitiveness leads to reduced readability. It's important to distinguish whether something is a variable, function, class, or just a simple variable name or function name, given the nature of JavaScript's ability to use variables for almost everything. This becomes even more crucial for improving readability.

Due to the varying naming conventions among companies, I've decided to define a simple one for myself this time around. The naming convention I'll be following is as follows:

// Since the naming convention details have grown, I've moved them to a file named "Naming Convention" inside the KR/Rule folder!

With this naming convention defined, I plan to proceed with changes step by step.
